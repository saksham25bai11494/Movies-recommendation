# 📌 Project Statement  
### 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Beginner Python)

---

## 📝 Introduction

This project is a **basic console-based Movie Recommendation System** created using Python.  
The goal of this application is to help users explore movies based on genres, discover random suggestions, and search or add movies interactively.

The project is designed for **beginners** who want to practice:
- Python Dictionaries
- Functions
- Loops
- Data handling using user input

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a simple, user-interactive Python program that:
- Recommends movies based on selected genres
- Provides a random movie suggestion
- Searches for movies by name
- Allows users to add new movies into the system

---

## 📌 Scope of the Project

The movie recommendation system **will include**:
- A predefined movie database categorized by genres
- Multiple user options (recommend, search, random pick, add movie)

The system **will not include** (in this basic version):
- Online database/API fetching
- Movie ratings, reviews, or detailed metadata
- Machine learning–based suggestions

## 🛠 Proposed Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Genre-based recommendation | User selects a genre and receives a list of movies |
| Random suggestion | System randomly recommends a movie |
| Search | User searches a movie by name (case-insensitive) |
| Add movie | User can add a movie to an existing or new genre |

---

## 📚 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Text-based console UI**
- **Basic Data Structures** (Dictionaries & Lists)

---

## 📌 Expected Output

- Display a menu of options
- Show recommendations or search results based on user choice
- Allow users to extend the movie database

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to create a user-friendly recommendation tool using fundamental programming concepts. It lays the foundation for more advanced systems that may later incorporate GUI design, online APIs, or machine learning techniques.
